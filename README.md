Google Scripts
======

_This is really just a collection of little projects I make while playing around with Google Apps Scripts_

> Google Apps Script is a scripting language based on JavaScript that lets you do new and cool things with G Suite products like Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms. There's nothing to install â€” they give you a code editor right in your browser, and your scripts run on Google's servers.
